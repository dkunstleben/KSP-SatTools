Description:
	Kerbal Space Program is a space simulation video game in which players can build and launch
spacecraft. Additional third party content makes non-manned craft require electricity at all times in order to function. Solar panels do not work when the sun is being blocked by the body the craft is currently orbiting, so guesswork was often needed to figure out how many battery power to give the craft.

	This tool was made to get an accurate estimate on how much battery power to give the spacecraft. It also adds a 20% safety margin.

Directions:
1) Select an orbiting Body from the dropdown
2) Enter range for target orbit, or just one target orbit
3) Enter craft's required electricity (Chg/s) (Optional)
4) If a range was entered for an orbit, specify an interval between measurements (Optional, default 1km)
